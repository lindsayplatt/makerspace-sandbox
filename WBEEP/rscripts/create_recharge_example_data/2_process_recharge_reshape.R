# Reshape data

library(data.table)

# Read in the RDS
# Transform them from wide (109K + columns) to long (3 columns)
#    The resulting columns will be Date, HRU, and Recharge_va
#    Use data.table `melt` to reshape them since they are so big.

# lplatt had to close all other applications and restart RStudio before running the 
#   readRDS + melt lines below in order to allocate enough memory on her computer.
